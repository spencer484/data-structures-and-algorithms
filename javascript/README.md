# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Language: `JavaScript`


## Singly Linked List

Using JavaScript to create algorithms to manipulate Singly Linked Lists.
Using JEST to write tests. 

# Stacks and Queues
Using Stack and Queue's

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency
Just used what we have learned from lecture to figure out the methods


Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
