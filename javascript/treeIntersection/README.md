# Challenge Summary
* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Challenge Description
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using hashtables makes this somewhat efficient. With this approach the hash tables maps to alinked list of item. As long as the number of collisions is fairly small, this will be quite efficient.
